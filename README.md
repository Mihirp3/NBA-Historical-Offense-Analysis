# NBA-Historical-Offense-Analysis

In this assignment for my Regression and Multivariate Analysis class, I conducted a time series regression and analysis based on league-wide historical offense data in the NBA. Each observation was a single season between the 1980-1981 season and the 2021-2022 season, for a total of 42 observations. I used offensive rating, which measures the amount of points scored per 100 possessions, as my response variable with 3 pointers attempted, free throws attempted, assists per 100 possessions, pace (possessions per game), and turnover percentage as my predictor variables. The report I submitted for the class is included in this repository, alongside the minitab file I used.
